Atmospheric Model Evaluation Tool
========
## Overview
The Atmospheric Model Evaluation Tool (AMET) was developed to aid in its evaluation of the meteorological and air quality models within the CMAQ modeling system. AMET organizes, provides consistency and speeds-up the evaluation process for operational meteorological and air quality model simulations. Although it was developed specifically to aid in the evaluation of the CMAQ modeling system, the AMET software can be adapted to work with other modeling systems.
